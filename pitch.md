Hi my name is Andres Galindo and we are the “velocir-astors” from Astor place. We have an idea that will modernize billboard ads with data driven targeting used in real-world digital ad spaces and allow ad companies to offer up to three times the market value. But before we get there, lets consider John.


John’s an up-and-coming businessman, living in New York City. Every day he commutes on the “A” line down to his office in the Lower East side. He’s in the area of NYU, where the ads are focused on college students: but he’s not interested in food delivery and student loan assistance. Every day he sees and ignores every ad in the subway.


Now imagine the following. When John sits down in the subway, Watson sees that he’s wearing a suit. Instead of an ad tailored to college students, an add for fine watches shows on the screen across the subway from John. Now he’s interested. As the ad changes to best match the group of people in the subway, each commuter gets a chance to see an ad that matches their interests. That’s the power of Smart Advertising.


An Adage.com report showed companies that used targeted online advertisements had user engagement increase by 1000%, the Network Advertisement Initiative reported ad agencies using the same technology were able to charge 2.8 times as much higher for a given ad space.


Were making a conservative estimate that companies using real-time smart ads powered by watson will be able to charge twice as much for a given ad space. We charge a 25% of that increase in revenue as a licensing fee. Enough for ad agenciec to recoup the initial hardware investment and keep a substantial increase in revenue.
